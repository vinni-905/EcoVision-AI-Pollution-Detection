🌍 Project Title

EcoVision: AI-Based Environmental Pollution Detection using CNN

🧠 Theme

Sustainability — Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning to support environmental protection and sustainable urban development.

💡 Problem Statement

Environmental pollution has become a critical global challenge, causing severe health, ecological, and economic impacts.
Most pollution detection and monitoring systems rely on manual surveys or expensive sensors, which are not scalable or real-time.
To promote sustainable cities, there is a need for a cost-effective and automated solution that can detect pollution levels from everyday images.

🎯 Objective

To develop an AI-powered image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that automatically detects the pollution level (Clean / Moderate / Polluted) from environmental images.
The project aims to:

Train a CNN model to classify environmental pollution levels using image data.

Build an easy-to-use interface for real-time pollution analysis.

Support sustainability and awareness through accessible AI-based monitoring.
